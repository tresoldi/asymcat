Library for symmetrical and assymetrical analysis of categorical co-occurrences

## Background

A measure of association is any factor or coefficient used to quantify
the relationship between two or more variables. Various measures exist to
determine the strength and relationship of such associations, the most
common being measures of *correlation* which, in a sense stricter than
*association*, refers to linear correlation. Among the most common measures,
are Pearson's **rho** coefficient of product-moment correlation for
continuous values, Spearman **rho** coefficient for measuring the strenght
of monotonic ordinal or ranked variables, Chi-square measure for
association between categorical values. Most measures only express
measures of either strength (such as Pearson's **rho**) or significance
(such as Chi-square), and are **symmetric**, meaning that, when
measuring the relationship between `x` and `y` the association between
a given value of `x` and a given value of `y` is equal to the association
between the same value of `y` and the same value of `x`.

While symmetric measures are the natural measure for numeric variables,
the analyses arising from many studies and applications for categorical
variables can in most cases benefit from asymmetric measures, as
the fraction of variability in `x` that is explainable by variations in `y` 
(Pearson, 2016). Such property can be easily demonstrated by modifying the
example given by (Zychlinski, 2018) while introducing his `dython`
library

  | x | y |
  |---|---|
  | A | c |
  | A | d |
  | A | c |
  | B | g |
  | B | g |
  | B | f |

In this example, the categorical value of `y` cannot be determined with full
certainty given `x`, but `x` can be determined with certainty from `y`.

The best known methods for measure of categorical association are the
aforementioned Chi-square and Cramer's V, defined as the square root of a
normalized chi-square value. Both are symmetric values. Among the best
known asymmetric measures are Theil's U and Goodman and Kruskal's tau.
The former is particularly useful for domains of the humanities such as
lingustic research, as it is ultimately based on the conditional entropy
between `x` and `y`, that is, how many possible states of `y` are observed
given `x` and how often they occur.

  |         | `A`  | `B`  |
  |---------|------|------|
  | **`c`** | 0.75 | 0.75 |
  | **`d`** | 0.00 | 0.00 |
  | **`f`** | 0.00 | 0.00 |
  | **`g`** | 0.75 | 0.75 |

  |         | `c`  | `d`  | `f`  | `g`  |
  |---------|------|------|------|------|
  | **`A`** | 0.75 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.75 |
  | **`B`** | 0.75 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.75 |

Even with a simple MLE scorer, the difference is evident

The `catcoocc` library implements a series of symmetric and asymmetric
measures for categorical association from co-occurrences, including two
new measures developed by the author, that cover a range of potential
usages first intended for but not limited to linguistic research.

## Installation and usage

The library can be installed as any standard Python library with `pip`:

```bash
pip install catcoocc
```

Detailed instructions on how to use the library can be found in
the [official documentation]().

A show-case example is shown here:

```python
import tabulate
import catcoocc
from catcoocc.scorer import CatScorer

mushroom_data = catcoocc.read_sequences("docs/mushroom-small.tsv")
mushroom_cooccs = catcoocc.collect_cooccs(mushroom_data)
scorer = catcoocc.scorer.CatScorer(mushroom_cooccs)

mle = scorer.mle()
pmi = scorer.pmi()
npmi = scorer.pmi(True)
chi2 = scorer.chi2()
chi2_ns = scorer.chi2(False)
cramersv = scorer.cramers_v()
cramersv_ns = scorer.cramers_v(False)
fisher = scorer.fisher()
theil_u = scorer.theil_u()
catcoocc_i = scorer.catcoocc_i()
catcoocc_ii = scorer.catcoocc_ii()

headers = [
    'pair',
    'mle_0',        'mle_1', 
    'pmi_0',        'pmi_1', 
    'npmi_0',       'npmi_1', 
    'chi2_0',       'chi2_1', 
    'chi2ns_0',     'chi2ns_1', 
    'cremersv_0',   'cremersv_1', 
    'cremersvns_0', 'cremersvns_1', 
    'fisher_0',     'fisher_1', 
    'theilu_0',     'theilu_1', 
    'catcoocci_0',  'catcoocci_1', 
    'catcooccii_0', 'catcooccii_1', 
]

table = []
for pair in sorted(scorer.obs):
    buf = [
        pair,
        "%0.4f" % mle[pair][0],         "%0.4f" % mle[pair][1],
        "%0.4f" % pmi[pair][0],         "%0.4f" % pmi[pair][1],
        "%0.4f" % npmi[pair][0],        "%0.4f" % npmi[pair][1],
        "%0.4f" % chi2[pair][0],        "%0.4f" % chi2[pair][1],
        "%0.4f" % chi2_ns[pair][0],     "%0.4f" % chi2_ns[pair][1],
        "%0.4f" % cramersv[pair][0],    "%0.4f" % cramersv[pair][1],
        "%0.4f" % cramersv_ns[pair][0], "%0.4f" % cramersv_ns[pair][1],
        "%0.4f" % fisher[pair][0],      "%0.4f" % fisher[pair][1],
        "%0.4f" % theil_u[pair][0],     "%0.4f" % theil_u[pair][1],
        "%0.4f" % catcoocc_i[pair][0],  "%0.4f" % catcoocc_i[pair][1],
        "%0.4f" % catcoocc_ii[pair][0], "%0.4f" % catcoocc_ii[pair][1],
    ]
    table.append(buf)

    
print(tabulate.tabulate(table, headers=headers, tablefmt='markdown'))
```

Which will output:

```bash
pair                       mle_0    mle_1    pmi_0    pmi_1    npmi_0    npmi_1    chi2_0    chi2_1    chi2ns_0    chi2ns_1    cremersv_0    cremersv_1    cremersvns_0    cremersvns_1    fisher_0    fisher_1    theilu_0    theilu_1    catcoocci_0    catcoocci_1    catcooccii_0    catcooccii_1
